      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 24, I have two older brothers. I have a major in psychology. Before bootcamp and COVID-19, I was serving in the Peace Corps in Ecuador. Now, I'm looking to change career paths and find a door into the tech world. I'm completely new to coding, but I've been doing a little bit of free practice with CodeAcademy.  </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Madison, MS</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to cook, play sports, hike, and read!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My absolute dream job is an astrophysist...</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Denver, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I'm not really qualified for much in the professional world and as I look through available work, I've found the only positions that interest me are tech-related. I like to build and solve problems so coding seemed the obvious next for me. </p>
